# Project: Star Tracker Lens Quality Assessment

Final project for a course in image analysis I took during my master programme.

---
Brief description: The goal was to compare 2 different lenses (unkown to us) by observing 2 separate sets of images of star fields acquired with those lenses and a camera system developed at my department (which produces images with a non-conventional format). Stars ideally should appear as dots but due to camera distortion had different shapes and these shapes are what we needed to analyze.

The description of the project is included here.

Also the final report is included.

---
Images were provided as binary files of format .UNC. We had a description of how data is organized into these files and we had to write code to create images out of these files from scratches.

The overall organization of the code and how it works is described in the report, pp 31-46 and the appendices (pp 60-85). I have no time to make a summary here, sorry!.

The project is overall meh... Code isn't optimized and we really didn't have any idea as to how we should've approached the problem and our project supervisor didn't gave us any guidance at all.
It was a group project. I performed the reading of the images, the entire preprocessing, and the object detection and selection.
I also wrote almost 90% of the entire report.

The classification of the distortion wasn't done by me and it didn't really work that well. After weeks of scratching our heads without any guidance my group mate had this idea but the theory used wasn't exactly suited for this specific task and it took him forever to develop the code to perform it. By the time he had some running code, we had no time left to find another solution so we handed in anyway (though I didn't want to).

The discussion of the results was not very conclusive in my opinion but we still passed the course with a good evaluation (consider that we were only 2 people and we still performed 80% better than another group of 5 people).

It's been my intention to review this project and try to improve it and make it into something good, but I've never had the time and I will never have I'm afraid.
